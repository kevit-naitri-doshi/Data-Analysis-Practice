## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to provide practical examples and exercises for learning and improving data analysis skills. The notebooks use real-world datasets and demonstrate step-by-step processes to analyze data effectively.

## Notebooks

The following is a list of the available notebooks:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Techniques for handling missing values, outliers, and data transformation.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Methods for summarizing the main characteristics of the data using visualizations and statistical measures.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Creating various types of plots and charts using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

4. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Performing hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and other statistical methods.

5. **Machine Learning**
   - Implementing machine learning algorithms for regression, classification, and clustering.

6. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Techniques for analyzing and forecasting time series data.
